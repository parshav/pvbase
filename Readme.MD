# pvBase

Tired of looking at other projects when starting a new personal one,
I created this as a base for reference to a new Android project.

### Features

The project has 2 modules. `base` and `app`. `app` does not contain
 any useful code in this repo.

 `base ` contains -->

#### BaseActivity

Abstract base Activity class that can be extended.

#### BaseScreen

Abstract base Fragment class that cn be extended.

#### Navigator

Simple navigator implementation, exposed via `NavigatorTemplate`.

#### ResourceHelper

Resource retriever class, only implementing strings for now.

### TODO

* Screen implementation example.
* Activity implementation example.
* Method to pull this repo and modify module name.
